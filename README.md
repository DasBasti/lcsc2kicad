# JLCPCB/LCSC SMT Parts library to KiCad Library Converter

Looks like JLCPCB does not provide a simple parts list anymore.

This script will fetch the current available parts for SMT 
assembly offered by JLCPCB and generate KiCad Part Library 
files.

To get the generated libraries go to: [kicad_jlcpcb_smt_parts](https://github.com/DasBasti/kicad_jlcpcb_smt_parts)

# Setup
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
    python generate.py
